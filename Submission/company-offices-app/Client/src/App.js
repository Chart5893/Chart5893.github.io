        <h2>üë§ Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          As I wrap up my Computer Science degree, I‚Äôm looking ahead to joining a small, focused development team where I can contribute meaningfully and continue growing. I‚Äôm not particularly interested in freelancing‚Äîthough I‚Äôm open to the idea if the right opportunity came along. What I really want is to be part of a collaborative group‚Äîfive to ten people‚Äîsolving problems together, building reliable software, and learning from each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest strengths I‚Äôm bringing out of this program is perseverance. There were times I felt stuck or overwhelmed, but I kept working through it...
            
            </p>
          <p>
            One of the things that really surprised me during this program was how simple processes‚Äîsmall pieces of logic or data‚Äîcan work together to create something much more complex. I knew that in theory before, but it hit differently once I started building real code. There‚Äôs something really cool about seeing that click into place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I came into this degree very unsure of my abilities. I doubted whether I had what it took to succeed in programming. Now, after all the coursework and challenges, I feel confident. I‚Äôve learned how to face unfamiliar problems and find solutions. Even if I don‚Äôt know something right away, I know how to learn it. I‚Äôve also discovered that I enjoy the challenges of full-stack development and AI. Both were difficult subjects, but they kept me engaged and pushed me to think differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this degree, I‚Äôve built a solid foundation across the core areas of computer science‚Äîfrom working with data structures and algorithms to building full-stack applications. I‚Äôve learned how to write code that‚Äôs not just functional, but also maintainable and scalable. My coursework emphasized clean design, modularity, and efficient problem-solving, and I‚Äôve applied those principles to each artifact in this portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication and collaboration have also been key takeaways. While my coding projects were often solo efforts, I‚Äôve had real-world experience leading teams of 15 or more people in retail management roles. That taught me how to coordinate efforts, resolve conflict, and motivate others‚Äîskills I know translate directly into a development team environment. I value clear communication, and I‚Äôve learned how important it is when discussing technical ideas with teammates or explaining decisions to non-technical stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve also built a strong understanding of database management, API integration, and full-stack development‚Äîespecially through my work on the Company Offices App. In every project, I try to think critically about security as well: validating inputs, anticipating misuse, and ensuring that my designs are resilient rather than fragile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The artifacts in this portfolio represent growth in three core areas of computer science: software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each one was selected intentionally‚Äînot just to check boxes, but because they challenged me in meaningful ways and gave me a chance to demonstrate what I‚Äôve learned.

          </p>
          <p>- Treasure Hunt Game: This project generates a maze that is then solved by an AI agent. For my capstone enhancement, I implemented a custom guidance algorithm to help the AI learn more efficiently. This demonstrates my understanding of AI behavior, reinforcement learning principles, and algorithm design, as well as the ability to develop heuristics and intelligent pathfinding strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Histogram Project: This artifact demonstrates my understanding of data structures and algorithms, with both CLI and GUI implementations that analyze and visualize text data.

          </p>
          <p>
            - Company Offices App: Built with React and MongoDB-style structures, this full-stack dashboard showcases my ability to work with databases, APIs, and front-end visualization in a cohesive web project.

          </p>
          <p>
            Together, these projects reflect a well-rounded skill set‚Äîand more importantly, they prove that I can approach problems from design to implementation and see them through.

          </p>
          <p>
            Putting this portfolio together has shown me just how far I‚Äôve come. I started this program unsure of what I could accomplish, but now I‚Äôve completed real projects, solved real problems, and built tools I‚Äôm proud of. I‚Äôm confident in my ability to contribute to a development team, learn new technologies as needed, and stay adaptable in a constantly changing field.

          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to the opportunities that earning this degree will provide me. While this period of change has been difficult at times, I‚Äôve come to understand that real growth only happens through discomfort‚Äîand I‚Äôm ready for what comes next.

          </p>

        <h2>üìÑ Artifact Narrative ‚Äì Company Offices App</h2>

        <p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br />
        The Company Offices App is a full-stack web application built using a React frontend and a MongoDB backend. It presents company data by founding year and by state using charts and tables for visual clarity and analysis.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why I Selected It:</strong><br />
        Originally, this artifact was intended to build on code I had written for interacting with a database to display company data. However, I realized that the original project was stored on a remote server I no longer had access to. Rather than abandon the idea, I chose to fully rebuild the entire application from scratch. This required creating a new MongoDB database, designing a backend API to connect to it, and developing a new React-based frontend to present the data.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Enhancements and Skills Demonstrated:</strong><br />
        The enhancements involved a complete rebuild and full implementation of both backend and frontend components. I designed and built a RESTful API to communicate with a MongoDB database, structured and seeded company data, and developed a React interface with dynamic charts and tables. I emphasized a clean UI and made sure the app followed logical component structure and routing.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>MongoDB schema design and database integration</li>
          <li>Backend development using Node.js and Express</li>

          <li>Frontend development with React and data visualization tools</li>
          <li>Applying full-stack practices and UI/UX principles</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Course Outcomes Met:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrate an ability to use innovative tools and frameworks in computing practices</li>
          <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions using computer science standards</li>
          <li>Communicate technical content through visual and interactive tools</li>
